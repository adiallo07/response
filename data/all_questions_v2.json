The asphalt is cracked and uplifted, with significant parts submerged under water. A pond or a shallow body of water created by the disaster is visible on one side of the road. The scene includes lush green palm trees lining the road, bending and swaying, suggesting recent strong winds. The ocean can be seen in the distance with rough waves, indicating stormy conditions. The presence of electrical poles leaning dangerously suggests a widespread impact on the infrastructure. The environment shows signs of devastation but also natural beauty, highlighting the resilience of coastal landscapes in the face of natural adversities."
