# RESPONSE : A Dataset for Commonsense Reasoning about Disaster Management

### Dataset summary

This dataset contains 1789 data instances with problem identification, missing resource, time-dependent questions and answers pairs for disaster management.  The prominent fields of interest are:

* problem: a description of the main problem a human may face in the incident depicted in the image
* context: A textual description of the incident situation. It is automatically generated by captioning an image from [Incidents 1M](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04236) 
* missing resource: the main missing resource (service, amenity) in the described incident situation
* solutions: a set of three sentences, one for each timeframe (immediately, after one week, after few days)  addressing how to replace or deal with the missing resource while dealing with the problem identified earlier. 
* explanations: natural language rationale to justify the validity of the solution
* scenario : list of natural language questions automatically generated, one per each timeframe, incident and place labels.
Additionally, the fields with the metadata are:
* id: an identifier form the source data corresponding to the image id.
* ann_id : an identifier for the set of annotators, either 0 or 1. The tuple (ann_id, id) is a unique identifier for the dataset instance.
